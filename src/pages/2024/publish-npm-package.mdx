With `npm publish` you can publish a NPM package, to do that you need to be logged, you can do it by using `npm login`.

You can initialize the package with `npm init --scope=@username` or add your username in the `package.json` to publish with your user scope.

```json
{
  "name": "@username/package-name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "test"
  }
}
```

When you make changes, update the version number in the `package.json`, according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

- Patch: 1.0.1 for bug fixes
- Minor: 1.1.0 for new features that are backwards-compatible
- Major: 2.0.0 for changes that break backwards compatibility

Also you can use file like `.npmignore` if there are files you donâ€™t want to publish, similar to `.gitignore`.

```bash
# .npmignore
/src
tsconfig.json
jest.config.js
```
