import { Anchor } from '@/components/article-elements'
export const components = { a: Anchor }

With the `--watch` flag you can restart the Node process when a file is saved. This only works with JavaScript files, if you need to do this with TypeScript you need to use [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).

```bash
node --watch index.js
```

The `--watch` flag is stable in Node v22.0.0 or later.

Read [Node `--watch` docs](https://nodejs.org/api/cli.html#--watch) for more information.
