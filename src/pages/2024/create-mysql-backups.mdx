With the `mysqldump` command you can create sql database backup file.

```bash
mysqldump -u username -p database_name > path\to\your\backup.sql
```

Once you have a sql file you can restore with the following command.

```bash
mysql -u username -p database_name < path\to\your\backup.sql
```

Maybe you need to navigate to the MySQL installation path to run this commands.

```bash
cd C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
```
