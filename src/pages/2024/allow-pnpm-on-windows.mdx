When you run external scripts for example `pnpm` in Windows you maybe get a Execution_Policies error. To fix this you need to change your execution policies.

First open PowerShell as administrator. Then run `Get-ExecutionPolicy` to get your current policies.

```bash
Get-ExecutionPolicy # Output expected: Restricted
```

Then change the execution policies to `RemoteSigned` using the `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy <PolicyName>` command.

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

This will change your execution policies and now you can run external scripts like `pnpm`.

Read more about execution policies in [Microsoft learn docs](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170).
