import { Anchor } from '@/components/article-elements'
export const components = { a: Anchor }

Using the external package [prisma-json-types-generator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prisma-json-types-generator) you can type JSON fields in Prisma.

1. Install and configure the package adding the json provider.

   ```prisma
   generator client {
     provider = "prisma-client-js"
   }

   /// Always after the prisma-client-js generator
   generator json {
     provider = "prisma-json-types-generator"
   }
   ```

2. Then update your model adding the type by using abstract syntax tree comments.

   ```prisma
   model User {
      id Int @id
      /// [UserAddress] <- Your type here
      address Json
   }
   ```

3. Finally declare the PrismaJson namespace adding your type.

   ```typescript
   declare global {
     namespace PrismaJson {
       interface UserAddress {
         city: string
         street: string
         postalCode: number
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Important**: Make sure the file has the extension `.d.ts`. Otherwise your types may not work.

Every time that you changed your declarations types, you need to migrate the scheme to implement it.
