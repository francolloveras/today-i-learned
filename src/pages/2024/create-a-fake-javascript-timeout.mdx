import { Anchor } from '@/components/article-elements'
export const components = { a: Anchor }

Using the `Promise()` constructor, you can create a fake timeout in one line of code.

```javascript
await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 5000))
```

Change the `5000` value to set the time to wait in miliseconds.
