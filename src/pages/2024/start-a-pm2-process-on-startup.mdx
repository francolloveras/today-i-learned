[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is a daemon process manager that will help you manage and keep your application online 24/7.

With the `start` command you can start your application.

```bash
pm2 start npm --name "my-application" -- start
```

Once your application is started you can check the status using `status`.

```bash
pm2 status
```

When the server restarts, the process will not start automatically. So, to fix this you need to save your process list using `save`.

```bash
pm2 save
```

Once your process list is saved you need to run `startup`.

```bash
pm2 startup
```

This command will output a command specific to your system's init system. For example you can see something like this.

```bash
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin pm2 startup <init-system> -u <user> --hp <home-path>
```

Finally, copy and run the command provided by the pm2 startup output.

After running the command, you can reboot your server and PM2 processes will be start automatically. Read more in [PM2 documentation](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/quick-start/).
