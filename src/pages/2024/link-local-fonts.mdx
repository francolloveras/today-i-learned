import { Anchor } from '@/components/article-elements'
export const components = { a: Anchor }

First you need the font file and the different font styles if it has one. And to link it you can use `@font-face` setting the name and the source.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Roboto';
  src: url('./roboto-regular.woff') format('woff');
}
```

Then you can use it as you normally use it.

```css
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}
```
