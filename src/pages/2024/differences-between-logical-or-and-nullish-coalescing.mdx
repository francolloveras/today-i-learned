import { Anchor } from '@/components/article-elements'
export const components = { a: Anchor }

Both operators are used to assign default valuesut they differ in how they determine what is considered a "falsy".

- Logical or (`||`): Returns the right-hand if the left-hand operand is falsy (`false`, `0`, `''`, `null`, `undefined`, and `NaN`).

- Nullish coalescing (`??`): Returns the right-hand operand if it is not `null` or `undefined`.

```javascript
const a = 0
const b = a || 5 // b will be 5, since 0 is falsy.
const c = a ?? 5 // c will be 0, since 0 is not null or undefined.
```
