First you need to know the process ID (PID), you can find this running the following command.

```bash
sudo lsof -i :PORT
```

This command will list all processes using the specified port, along with their PID.

Then with the PID number and the `kill` command you can terminate it.

```bash
sudo kill PID
```

If `sudo kill PID` doesn't remove the process, you might need to use a more forceful termination signal, such as `SIGKILL`.

Use the `kill` command with the `-9` option to send the SIGKILL signal.

```bash
sudo kill -9 PID
```
