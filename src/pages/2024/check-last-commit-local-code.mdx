You can use `git log -1` thats show you the most recent commit, including details like the commit hash, author, date, and commit message.

```bash
git log -1
```

Also you can use `git show --oneline -s`, this will display just the commit hash and the commit message of the last commit.

```bash
git show --oneline -s
```
