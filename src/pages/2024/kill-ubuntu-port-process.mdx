import { Anchor } from '@/components/article-elements'
export const components = { a: Anchor }

First you need to identify the Process ID `PID` using the port.

```bash
lsof -i :PORT # For example: lsof -i :3000
```

Once you have the `PID` you can use the `kill` command to kill the process.

```bash
kill PID # For example: kill 12345
```

If the process does not terminate, you can use the `-9` option to forcefully kill it.

```bash
kill -9 PID # For example: kill -9 12345
```
