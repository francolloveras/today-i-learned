Using `INSERT INTO ... SELECT` can copy table from one database to another.

```sql
INSERT INTO target_db.table SELECT * FROM source_db.table;
```

Also can be use `mysqldump` to copy a table with its structure and data.

```bash
mysqldump -u user -p source_db table > table_dump.sql
mysql -u user -p target_db < table_dump.sql
```

Read more about `mysqldump` in [Create and restore MySQL backups](/today-i-learned/2024/create-mysql-backups) post.
