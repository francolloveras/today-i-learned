import { Anchor } from '@/components/article-elements'
export const components = { a: Anchor }

First you need to clone the repository that you want to get a specific commit.

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

Then navigate into cloned repository and check out the commit you need using its hash.

```bash
git checkout <commit-hash>
```

This will put your working directory in a detached HEAD state at the specified commit.
